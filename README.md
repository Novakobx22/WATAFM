# 102.3 WATA FM
Video Games &amp; Chill. A radio station created in Dubtrack.FM. 

102.3 WATA FM is a radio station located inside of Dubtrack.FM focused heavily on video game and chill music. In case you don't know what chill music is, it is a genre of music intended for relaxation. In fact, relaxation is pretty much WATA FM's goal. Listeners to WATA FM can personalize the station to make it their own by submitting tracks to the queue to be played live on air. 


# Events

Sunday | Easy Listening Breakfast (7 AM - 2 PM EST): Rise and shine! It's Sunday morning, so why not start your day with some easy listening music? From 7 AM to 2 PM Eastern Standard Time every Sunday, we'll play easy listening music to our viewers. During this time, only easy listening music is allowed. No video game music or any music that is not considered to be easy listening music.

Also Sunday | Shitpost Frenzy (8 PM - 10 PM EST): Finish the weekend with some good ol' meme music! For two hours, we'll accept nearly any memes for music!

EVENT RULES FOR SHITPOST FRENZY:

1. No ear-rape.
2. Keep common meme songs, like All-Star and Rick Roll, to a limit.
3. While some swears are allowed, songs that are littered with them are strictly forbidden.

Tuesday | Cartoon Tuesday (All Day): Relive the 90's with Cartoon Tuesday! Every Tuesday, WATA FM will play music from classic cartoons, whatever channel it was on back in the day! We will also accept music from current cartoons.

Thursday | Throwback Thursday (All Day): It's time to go back in time! Every Thursday, viewers can submit video game music from every console/handheld console all the way up to the GameCube/Dreamcast/PS2. This is the only day where chill music is forbidden and only video game music can be played.

Saturday | All Genre Saturday (All Day): Feel free to post music from any genre all day long! Want to play jazz? That's allowed. Want to submit rock? That's completely fine. During this event, you can submit any type of music as long as it doesn't break the rules!

*During all events, except for Easy Listening Breakfast and Throwback Thursday, you can still submit regular video game/chill music. During ELB, video game music is forbidden, and during Throwback Thursday, chill music that


# Rules

1. Since we include chill music, all music must be at least relaxing, including the video game music, except for special events. This means no dubstep, rock, or any type of music that is considered too crazy/loud.

2. Although we're pretty sure calm music won't have any of this, we are still going to say that songs with any swear words, except for light ones, like hell,damn,etc, are prohibited. This rule will be slightly less enforced during Shitpost Frenzy on Sundays.

3. Music can only be up to 6 minutes in length. Other submitters are waiting to hear their song to be played.

4. For video game music, OG, remixes, and covers are considered fine. Mashups are not allowed, except on Shitpost Frenzy. 

5. Also for video game music, try not to play too many songs from one soundtrack. As great-sounding as some soundtracks are, we want to keep the music rotation as original as possible.

6. If you have music you created that you would like to submit into the queue, that is absolutely fine, unless you self-promote.
