# 102.3 WATA FM
Video Games &amp; Chill. A radio station created in Dubtrack.FM. 

102.3 WATA FM is a radio station located inside of Dubtrack.FM focused heavily on video game and chill music. In case you don't know what chill music is, it is a genre of music intended for relaxation. In fact, relaxation is pretty much WATA FM's goal. Listeners to WATA FM can personalize the station to make it their own by submitting tracks to the queue to be played live on air. 


# Rules

1. Since we include chill music, all music must be at least relaxing, including the video game music, except for special events. This means no dubstep, rock, or any type of music that is considered too crazy/loud.

2. Although we're pretty sure calm music won't have any of this, we are still going to say that songs with any swear words, except for light ones, like hell,damn,etc, are prohibited. 

3. Music can only be up to 6 minutes in length. Other submitters will be waiting to hear their song to be played.

4. For video game music, OG, remixes, and covers are considered fine. Mashups are not allowed.

5. Also for video game music, try not to play too many songs from one soundtrack. As great-sounding as some soundtracks are, we want to keep the music rotation as original as possible.

6. If you have music you created that you would like to submit into the queue, that is absolutely fine, unless you self-promote.
